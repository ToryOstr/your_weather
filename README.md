This is educational project [Your Weather](https://your-weather.space/) realised on React.js with [GeoDB API](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities) and [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) 


The application consists of functional components.

The animation of the logo is realized with the help of [framer-motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion), and the animation on start page- with the useEffect react hook.

The Search component is implemented using [react-select-async-paginate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select-async-paginate), and the weather forecast cards are wrapped in the [Swiper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swiper) react component. 


The useState react hook was used to update the screen
